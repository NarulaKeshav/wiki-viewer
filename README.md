# Wiki-Viewer
Wikipedia Viewer is an application that uses Wikipedia's API to get the search results for the input search and displays the results in card with title and description. Clicking the card would take you to the WikiPedia page.

Along with that, you can decide to choose a random article which is also displayed as a card.
